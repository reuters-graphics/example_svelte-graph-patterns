## About

This project is a collection of examples and templates for working with Svelte in a number of situations that commonly arise when making D3 graphs, scrollytelling webpages and other kinds of content we often produce.

It is meant to be a continuous work in progress 🛠️ and is by no means an exhaustive, or necessarily a 'best practices' 👓 type of collection. All the examples are use cases that I have encountered, built a minimal example around and documented. They come with working code, explained code snippets and notes about the approach taken. 
⚠️ They might come with links to the Svelte repl where I originally worked on the example, but these are not always the latest or the best version. 

## Running the project
- Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn` 
- Start the dev server with: `npm run dev` or or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab with `npm run dev -- --open`
